# Overview
This is a collection of scripts to use on the HCAL teststands.

# Documentation
Here is a short summary of what the different scripts do:

* `versions.py`: Displays software and firmware versions of the different teststand components. So far it displays information for the AMC13, GLIB, and Bridge FPGA.
* `qie_card_valid.py`: Determines if a QIE card is operating correctly. This is ver incomplete code; so far it just tests that the card's CIDs are rotating.
